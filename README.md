This React app demonstrates proper component architecture as well as state management with Redux using the following data flow: Action/Event -> Dispatch -> Reducer -> Store -> State -> View. I enjoyed using Redux because it avoids "prop drilling" and while it takes some configuration time, I can see how it allows applications to be built in a much more scalable manner. I also learned how to implement Google's Firebase as a backend for user auth and database management. Bitcoin payments were added using OpenNode's api (supports both on-chain and lightning payments) which I am very familiar with. Stripe payments are implemented via Stripe api but commented out.
